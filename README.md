# Roast-O-Matic üéØ

### Project Description
An AI-powered Malayalam roasting machine that monitors what you do on your screen and delivers savage, real-time roasts based on it.
Basically, it‚Äôs your personal insult generator who never misses a chance to hurt your feelings.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too comfortable on their computers. 
They waste time, open 37 Chrome tabs, watch ‚Äújust one more‚Äù YouTube video, and still think they‚Äôre productive. 
But no one is there to constantly remind them of their life choices in their native language.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We fixed that. Our app spies on your screen, judges you silently, and then roasts you in spicy Malayalam ‚Äî out loud.
Whether you‚Äôre procrastinating, gaming, or binge-watching cat videos at 3 AM, it will make sure you feel maximum shame, minimum productivity, and 100% entertainment.

### Project Demo
# Video
https://youtu.be/7f-Vt7RzziI?si=uChPXJ7vGLcHBbV4
*The video showcases GreenBytes Roast-O-Matic in action. It captures the user‚Äôs screen live, extracts visible text like browser tabs or app content, then uses the Gemini API to analyze the context and generate a sharp, humorous roast in Malayalam. The roast is converted to speech and played aloud in real-time, highlighting how the app calls out unproductive behavior instantly and entertainingly. Watch as the user gets roasted for procrastinating and wasting time, demonstrating the app‚Äôs potential to keep you accountable in a fun way.
